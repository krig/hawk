== Overview ==

Hawk is a web-based GUI for managing and monitoring Pacemaker HA
clusters.  It is generally intended to be run on every node in the
cluster, so that you can just point your web browser at any node
to access it, e.g.:

https://your-server:7630/

Hawk requires users to log in prior to providing access to the
cluster.  The same rules apply as for the python GUI; you need to
log in as a user in the +haclient+ group.  The easiest thing to do
is assign a password to the +hacluster+ user, then log in using
that account.  Note that you will need to configure this user
account on every node you want to use Hawk on.

Once logged in, you will see a screen showing the current state of
the cluster.  Three views are possible (summary, tree and table),
selectable with the buttons on the top right of the screen.  The
navigation bar down the left hand side provides access to the history
explorer, setup wizard, cluster properties, resource and constraints
configuration.  The little tools menu next to the logout link gives
you the simulator, cluster diagram and hb_report generation.

Management operations (start, stop, online, standby, etc.) can be
performed by clicking the little menu icon to the right of any
node or resource on the status screen.

== Installation ==

=== Dependencies ===

Hawk is a Ruby on Rails app which runs from a standalone instance
of lighttpd. It requires:

* crmsh
* graphviz
* graphviz-gd
* lighttpd
* pacemaker
* ruby

For details on the rubygems used by hawk, see the gemfile in +hawk/Gemfile+.

Some dependencies may differ depending on the distribution:

* rubygem-ruby-fcgi (openSUSE)
* rubypick (Fedora)

When building Hawk from source, you will also need rubygem-gettext
and the pacemaker, glib2, libxml2 and pam devel libraries.

=== Installing The Easy Way ===

Hawk is included with SLE HA 11 SP1, openSUSE 11.4, and later
SUSE releases. Recent versions are also available
http://software.opensuse.org/download?project=network:ha-clustering:Stable&package=hawk[for download from OBS].

Just install the RPM, then run:

--------------------------------------
# chkconfig hawk on
--------------------------------------
--------------------------------------
# /etc/init.d/hawk start
--------------------------------------

=== Installing The Other Easy Way ===

If you have a SUSE- or Fedora-based system, you can build
an RPM easily from the source tree.  Just clone this git repo,
and run "make rpm".

Once built, install the RPM on your cluster nodes and:

--------------------------------------
# chkconfig hawk on
--------------------------------------
--------------------------------------
# /etc/init.d/hawk start
--------------------------------------

=== Installing The Hard Way ===

If the above RPM build doesn't work for you, you can build and install
straight from the source tree, but _read the Makefile first_ to ensure
you'll be happy with the outcome!

--------------------------------------
# make
--------------------------------------
--------------------------------------
# sudo make install
--------------------------------------

The above will install in +/srv/www/hawk+ and run from a SUSE-style init
script. To install somewhere else (e.g.: +/var/www/hawk+) and/or to
use a Red Hat-style init script, try:

--------------------------------------
# make WWW_BASE=/var/www INIT_STYLE=redhat
--------------------------------------
--------------------------------------
# sudo make WWW_BASE=/var/www INIT_STYLE=redhat install
--------------------------------------

=== Installing The Other Hard Way ===

Grab the SRPM from OBS, for example try the one in
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/ha-clustering:/Stable/Fedora_19/src/
if you're using Fedora 19, and build that.


== A Note on SSL Certificates ==

The Hawk init script will automatically generate a self-signed SSL
certificate, in +/etc/lighttpd/certs/hawk-combined.pem+.  If you want
to use your own certificate, replace this file with one of your creation.
Note that this is a combined key and certificate, i.e.  you'll need to
+cat key cert > hawk-combined.pem+.


== Hacking Hawk ==

To hack on Hawk we recommend to use the vagrant setup. There is a
Vagrantfile attached, maybe you need to change some values to get access
to the correct files as the current locations are restricted to SUSE
emplyees.

To be prepared for getting our vagrant setup running you need to follow
some steps.

* Install the vagrant package from http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html,
  the minimal version requirement is +>= 1.7.0+ in order to work properly
  with openSUSE/SLED workstation setups.

* Install +virtualbox+, we assume you know how to do that on your OS. If
  you prefer +libvirt+ you can use that as well. In either case you have to
  install the bindfs plugin for vagrant with the following command if you
  want to have write access to the shared source folder within the virtual
  machine:

--------------------------------------
  # vagrant plugin install vagrant-bindfs
--------------------------------------

This is all you need to prepare initally to set up the vagrant environment,
now you can simply start the virtual machine with +vagrant up+ and start
an ssh session with +vagrant ssh webui+ based on +virtualbox+. To start the
virtual machines on +libvirt+ you have to append +--provider=libvirt+ to the
above commands, e.g. +vagrant up --provider=libvirt+. If you want to access
the source within the virtual machine you have to switch to the +/vagrant+
directory.

You can access the Hawk web interface based on the git source through
+http://localhost:3000+ now. If you want to access the version installed
through packages you can reach it through +https://localhost:7630+.

If you need to change something on +hawk_chkpwd+, +hawk_invoke+ or
+hawk_monitor+ you need to provision the machine again with the command
+vagrant provision+ to get this scripts compiled and copied to the correct
places, setuid-root and group to haclient in /usr/bin again. You should
end up with something like:

--------------------------------------
# ls /usr/sbin/hawk_* -l+ +
-rwsr-x--- 1 root haclient 9884 2011-04-14 22:56 /usr/sbin/hawk_chkpwd+
-rwsr-x--- 1 root haclient 9928 2011-04-14 22:56 /usr/sbin/hawk_invoke+
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     9992 2011-04-14 22:56 /usr/sbin/hawk_monitor+
--------------------------------------

+hawk_chkpwd+ is almost identical to +unix2_chkpwd+, except it restricts
acccess to users in the +haclient+ group, and doesn't inject any delay
when invoked by the +hacluster+ user (which is the user Hawk's lighttpd
instance runs as).

+hawk_invoke+ allows the +hacluster+ user to run a small assortment
of Pacemaker CLI tools as another user in order to support Pacemaker's
ACL feature.  It is used by Hawk when performing various management
tasks.

+hawk_monitor+ is not installed setuid-root.  It exists to be polled
by the web browser, to facilitate near-realtime updates of the cluster
status display.  It is not used when running Hawk via WEBrick.


If the development hawk instance isn't running, it can be started using this command:

--------------------------------------
webui:/vagrant/hawk # sudo -u vagrant script/rails s
--------------------------------------
