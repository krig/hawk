    #  - Need to not overwrite R/O properties (dc-version)
    #  - Can't just replace the whole XML chunk, there might
    #    be rules and scores and things we don't understand,
    #    so really we need to do a merge of nvpairs.
    # Really we want to mostly rely on the shell here.  Shame we
    # can't use the shell to remove properties by specifying
    # a null value to "crm configure property ...", or by
    # replacing sections.
    #
    # TODO(should): if the user deletes all the properties, this
    #               may leave an empty property set lying around.
    #               should "crm configure delete" it, but it
    #               might be a bit unsafe.
