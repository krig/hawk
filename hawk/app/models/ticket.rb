# This thing is what the crm shell refers to as rsc_ticket (and indeed,
# that's what it is in the CIB too), but we're calling it Ticket for
# consistency with Hawk's Location, Order and Colocation nomenclature.
# I figured the least worst choice was to maintain consistent naming
# within Hawk source, although...  For "perfection" (hah!) we'd be
# better off more rigidly following the CIB and use RscTicket, RscOrder,
# RscColocation, RscLocation.
# TODO(could): Revisit naming of constraint classes

# Note: Unlike Colocation and Order (which always fold to resource set
# notation), @resources is just a flat array with each element specifying
# resource ID and role.  Trust me, it's easier that way.
